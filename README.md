## Self Host
To self host yasen, you will need those packages installed on your system:
* Python3.6+: https://www.python.org/downloads/ Python3.5 and below is not supported
* FFmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/
* SQLite3: https://www.sqlite.org/


In addition, you will need to execute the following command to install required libraries:

First cd into the directory where yasen is located, then:
```
$ pip3 install cffi
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
On Linux, you might run into trouble installing PyNaCl, please refer to the below image.

Then you will need to rename ``sample_mydb`` to ``mydb`` in the ``data`` directory and rename ``sample_api.py`` to ``api.py`` in the ``config`` directory, and fill out the api keys inside.

Then to run, execute ``yasen-baka.py`` in the root directory with a python3.6+ interpreter, or execute ``run.sh`` on GNU/Linux or MacOS, ``run.bat`` on Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Windows<sup>®</sup>.
